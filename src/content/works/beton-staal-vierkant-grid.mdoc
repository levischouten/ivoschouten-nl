### beton | staal | vierkant | grid

At Broedplaats Bogotá, near Amsterdam, I will make a new composition every month from the concrete slabs present on the site. The weathered steel, the rough concrete and the massiveness appealed to me so much that all kinds of ideas for installations immediately arose. The seemingly obstructive square concrete slabs and the existing grid are the ideal building blocks for creating a series of site-specific works. Over the course of a year, twelve different compositions will be created.
