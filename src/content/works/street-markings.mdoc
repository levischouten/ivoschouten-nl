###### Street markings

Street markings literally show the way and to stay on the right path. By re-arranging the markings, you disconnect them from their original function and open them up for different directions. The results of this are twofold. It inspires to explore new directions by creating new compositions, and it stimulates to keep an open mind in general.

All works are based on street markings in Amsterdam.
